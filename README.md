# "files.insertFinalNewline": true

This file can do different things for the coding while being true or false. While being true, no matter what the contents are before the save, the file will be saved to the disk with /n and it will always be added as the last character. If you don't want to see the /n, then you can write "editor.renderFinalNewline": false and it will get rid of that extra line.
