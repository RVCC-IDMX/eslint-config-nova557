# Eslint-config

## Let's Learn a VS Code Setting

The rule that I chose to research is "files.insertFinalNewline": true. This rule can do different things for the coding while being true or false. While being true, no matter what the contents are before the save, the file will be saved to the disk with /n and it will always be added as the last character. If you don't want to see the /n, then you can write "editor.renderFinalNewline": false and it will get rid of that extra line, so there will be no extension to the file.

## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

Another rule that I found is "eslint no-trailing-spaces: "error." For this rule it disallows things such as spaces, tabs, and other Unicode whitespace characters at the end of lines. It can allow and disallow any trailing whitespaces and blank lines.
